      <p>
        From my teen years, I've always been a bit more analytical and Computer Science was fascinating to me. Being introduced to coding from a young age was the major driving force which enabled me to take up this course.
        As Technology advanced, new trends or fields of CompSci were introduced in which Data Science was the most suitable for me basing upon my previous interests and my inclination towards certain Mathematic topics.
